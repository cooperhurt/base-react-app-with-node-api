# Base React App with Node.JS API

This is a basic template to get you started on using a React application with a Node.JS/Express backend.

## Installation

Once you have downloaded/forked the repositiory you should be able to do '''npm i''' in the root directory. This will install the package concurrently
that allows you to run multiple commands at once. Once that is installed you should be now be able to run '''npm run setup''' this will cd into the
api and ui directories and do '''npm i'''.

Once that command is done you should be able to run '''npm start''' this will do a similary process but instead of '''npm i''' it will actually run '''npm start''', this will allow the UI to start up simultaneously.
